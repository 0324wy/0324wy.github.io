      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;Short-term wind speed forecast is of great importance to wind farm regulation and its early warning. Previous studies mainly focused on the prediction at a single location but few extended the task to 2-D wind plane. In this study, a novel deep learning model was proposed for a 2-D regional wind speed forecast, using the combination of the auto-encoder of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory unit (LSTM). The 12-hidden-layer deep CNN was adopted to encode the high dimensional 2-D input into the embedding vector and inversely, to decode such latent representation after it was predicted by the LSTM module based on historical data. The model performance was compared with parallel models under different criteria, including MAE, RMSE and R2, all showing stable and considerable enhancements. For instance, the overall MAE value dropped to 0.35 m/s for the current model, which is 32.7%, 28.8% and 18.9% away from the prediction results using the persistence, basic ANN and LSTM model. Moreover, comprehensive discussions were provided from both temporal and spatial views of analysis, revealing that the current model can not only offer an accurate wind speed forecast along timeline (R2 equals to 0.981), but also give a distinct estimation of the spatial wind speed distribution in 2-D wind farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;Accurate short-term wind speed prediction is of great significance for early warning and regulation of wind farms. At present, the scale of wind speed time-history data is increasing, and its time resolution is also becoming higher. Traditional machine learning models cannot effectively capture and utilize nonlinear features from the large scaled dataset and this, not only increases the difficulty of model building, but also reduces the prediction accuracy. To overcome such challenges, a machine learning based framework involving data-mining method was proposed in this paper. To begin with, a powerful signal decomposition technique (ensemble empirical mode decomposition) was used to divide the original wind sequence into several intrinsic mode functions to form a potential feature set. Then, a more appropriate sub-feature set together with the corresponding machine learning model were automatically generated through an iteration process. Such process was constructed through a coupled algorithm using the binary coded searching method known as the genetic algorithm and the advanced recurrent neural network with long short term memory unit. The analytical results show that, when compared with the traditional mainstream models, the strategy of using the sequences provided by the signal decomposition technology as the input features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. On the other hand, faced with the high-dimensional feature set generated from the big data, the selected sub-feature set can not only perform a large dimension reduction, but also further improve the prediction accuracy up to 28.33% in terms of different kinds of evaluation criteria. Therefore, there is a potential application of the proposed method on more accurate short-term wind speed prediction under a considerable dataset of wind history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Framework of airfoil max lift-to-drag ratio prediction using hybrid feature mining and Gaussian process regression.</title>
      <link>https://0324wy.github.io/publication/frame/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;The maximum lift-to-drag coefficient of an airfoil directly affects the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine. Machine learning methods are known for being really effective in helping to predict this parameter in a faster and more accurate way. So far, the majority of related studies have focused on the use of artificial neural networks to make this prediction, but this model has issues with its poor interpretation and the confidence level of its results was unclear. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed, involving the Gaussian process regression and a hybrid feature mining process. The aim is to use the new framework to evaluate the maximum lift-to-drag ratio of given airfoils under a turbulent flow condition, where the Reynolds number is around 100,000. The feature mining process here designed contains a hybrid feature pool that comprises various geometric characters, and a hybrid feature selector that can assist the prediction performance and make it better. Based on the airfoil dataset of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that contains a total of 1432 profiles, a comparative analysis was conducted. The results showed that the current framework can provide a more accurate estimate than parallel models in both single-point and interval aspects of view. Noticeably, the model reached an overall precision of 95.2% and 94.1% on training and testing sets, respectively. Moreover, the simplicity and the confidence reference from the model output were further illustrated with a case study, which also verified that how it can serve real engineering application.&lt;/p&gt;
